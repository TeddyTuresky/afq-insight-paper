  <h3>The three approaches</h3>

    <p style="text-align: left;">
      In the first approach, researchers use machine learning techniques to
      predict clinical diagnoses from brain measures, such as the white matter
      integrity at all points along an anatomical tract. This approach can
      achieve high accuracy, but may require extensive feature engineering.
      It may additionally obscure the importance of particular brain features.

  <div class="fragment current-visible" data-fragment-index="2">
    <img class="logo" src="img/tractometry_approach_1.svg" width="470" align="middle" alt="Old approach #1: machine learning for clinical diagnosis">
    <img class="logo" src="img/tractometry_approach_2.svg" width="940" align="middle" alt="Old approach #2: mass univariate statistics to learn white matter correlates">
    <p style="text-align: left;">
      In the second approach, researchers make group comparisons between
      patients and controls in order to understand the relationship between
      a disease or disorder and the underlying anatomy. Typically, researchers
      adopt a mass univariate approach, which lacks the predictive power of
      approach #1 and can fail to account for feature colinearity.

    <p style="text-align: left;">
      In this work, we adopt an approach that can predict clinical diagnoses
      while also revealing important features of the underlying neuroanatomy.
      It requires no apriori feature selection but instead capitalizes on the
      known group structure of diffusion MRI data.
