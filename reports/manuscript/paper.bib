              level. Having originated within the realm of diffusion NMR in the
              late 1970s, this field is experiencing an exponential growth in
              the number of publications. At the same time, model-based
              approaches are also increasingly incorporated into advanced MRI
              acquisition and reconstruction techniques. However, after about
              two decades of intellectual and financial investment,
              microstructural mapping has yet to find a single commonly
              accepted clinical application. Here, we suggest that slow

  abstract = "Diffusion MRI is arguably the method of choice for characterizing
              white matter microstructure in vivo. Over the typical duration of
              diffusion encoding, the displacement of water molecules is
              conveniently on a length scale similar to that of the underlying
              cellular structures. Moreover, water molecules in white matter
              are largely compartmentalized which enables biologically-inspired
              compartmental diffusion models to characterize and quantify the
              true biological microstructure. A plethora of white matter models
              have been proposed. However, overparameterization and
              mathematical fitting complications encourage the introduction of
              simplifying assumptions that vary between different approaches.
              These choices impact the quantitative estimation of model
              parameters with potential detriments to their biological accuracy
              and promised specificity. First, we review biophysical white
              matter models in use and recapitulate their underlying
              assumptions and realms of applicability. Second, we present
              up-to-date efforts to validate parameters estimated from
              biophysical models. Simulations and dedicated phantoms are useful
              in assessing the performance of models when the ground truth is
              known. However, the biggest challenge remains the validation of
              the ``biological accuracy'' of estimated parameters.
              Complementary techniques such as microscopy of fixed tissue
              specimens have facilitated direct comparisons of estimates of
              white matter fiber orientation and densities. However, validation
              of compartmental diffusivities remains challenging, and
              complementary MRI-based techniques such as alternative diffusion
              encodings, compartment-specific contrast agents and metabolites
              have been used to validate diffusion models. Finally, white
              matter injury and disease pose additional challenges to modeling,
              which are also discussed. This review aims to provide an overview
              of the current state of models and their validation and to

              cortical projection zones of white matter fascicles in the living
              human brain. There are many different tractography algorithms and
              each requires the user to set several parameters, such as
              curvature threshold. Choosing a single algorithm with specific
              parameters poses two challenges. First, different algorithms and
              parameter values produce different results. Second, the optimal
              choice of algorithm and parameter value may differ between
              different white matter regions or different fascicles, subjects,
              and acquisition parameters. We propose using ensemble methods to
              reduce algorithm and parameter dependencies. To do so we separate
              the processes of fascicle generation and evaluation.
              Specifically, we analyze the value of creating optimized
              connectomes by systematically combining candidate streamlines
              from an ensemble of algorithms (deterministic and probabilistic)
              and systematically varying parameters (curvature and stopping

              that provide better cross-validated prediction error of the
              diffusion MRI data than optimized connectomes generated using a
              single-algorithm or parameter set. Furthermore, the ensemble
              approach produces connectomes that contain both short- and
              long-range fascicles, whereas single-parameter connectomes are
              biased towards one or the other. In summary, a systematic
              ensemble tractography approach can produce connectomes that are
              superior to standard single parameter estimates both for

               However a fundamental limitation of this technology is its
               non-quantitative nature, i.e. the density of reconstructed
               connections is not reflective of the density of underlying white

               published the ``spherical-deconvolution informed filtering of

               orientation information from diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI)
               data, overcoming the crossing fibre limitations inherent in the
               diffusion tensor model. It is routinely used to obtain high
               quality fibre orientation distribution function (fODF) estimates
               and fibre tractograms and is increasingly used to obtain
               apparent fibre density (AFD) measures. Unfortunately, CSD
               typically only supports data acquired on a single shell in
               q-space. With multi-shell data becoming more and more prevalent,
               there is a growing need for CSD to fully support such data.
               Furthermore, CSD can only provide high quality fODF estimates in
               voxels containing WM only. In voxels containing other tissue
               types such as grey matter (GM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF),
               the WM response function may no longer be appropriate and
               spherical deconvolution produces unreliable, noisy fODF

               multi-shell data into the CSD approach as well as to exploit the
               unique b-value dependencies of the different tissue types to

              features specific to the intra- and extra-neurite compartments in
              nervous tissue unconfounded by the effects of fibre crossings and
              orientation dispersion, which are ubiquitous in the brain. The
              proposed MRI method is based on the Spherical Mean Technique
              (SMT), which factors out the neurite orientation distribution and
              thus provides direct estimates of the microscopic tissue
              structure. This technique can be immediately used in the clinic
              for the assessment of various neurological conditions, as it
              requires only a widely available off-the-shelf sequence with two

              1400-1800 x 10(-6) mm2/s) is almost 10 times higher than the

              studies cannot be done in humans, and animal results cannot
              always be extrapolated to human systems. We have developed

              utilizing the unique ability of MRI to characterize water
              diffusion. We reconstructed fiber trajectories throughout the
              brain by tracking the direction of fastest diffusion (the fiber
              direction) from a grid of seed points, and then selected tracks

              scalar invariants in entire tracts, such as the mean diffusivity
              (MD) differences found in AF. We report TBM results of higher
              fractional anisotropy (FA) in the left hemisphere in AF (caused
              primarily by lower lambda(3), the smallest eigenvalue of the
              diffusion tensor, in the left AF), and higher left hemisphere FA
              in CB (related to higher lambda(1), the largest eigenvalue of the
              diffusion tensor, in the left CB). By mapping the significance
              levels onto the tractography trajectories for each structure, we
              demonstrate the anatomical locations of the interhemispheric
              differences. The TBM approach brings analysis of DTI data into
              the clinically and neuroanatomically relevant framework of the
              tract anatomy.",

  title    = "Nonparametric permutation tests for functional neuroimaging: a

  abstract = "Requiring only minimal assumptions for validity, nonparametric
              permutation testing provides a flexible and intuitive methodology
              for the statistical analysis of data from functional neuroimaging
              experiments, at some computational expense. Introduced into the
              functional neuroimaging literature by Holmes et al. ([1996]: J
              Cereb Blood Flow Metab 16:7-22), the permutation approach readily
              accounts for the multiple comparisons problem implicit in the
              standard voxel-by-voxel hypothesis testing framework. When the
              appropriate assumptions hold, the nonparametric permutation
              approach gives results similar to those obtained from a
              comparable Statistical Parametric Mapping approach using a
              general linear model with multiple comparisons corrections
              derived from random field theory. For analyses with low degrees
              of freedom, such as single subject PET/SPECT experiments or
              multi-subject PET/SPECT or fMRI designs assessed for population
              effects, the nonparametric approach employing a locally pooled
              (smoothed) variance estimate can outperform the comparable
              Statistical Parametric Mapping approach. Thus, these
              nonparametric techniques can be used to verify the validity of
              less computationally expensive parametric approaches. Although
              the theory and relative advantages of permutation approaches have
              been discussed by various authors, there has been no accessible
              explication of the method, and no freely distributed software
              implementing it. Consequently, there have been few practical
              applications of the technique. This article, and the accompanying
              MATLAB software, attempts to address these issues. The standard
              nonparametric randomization and permutation testing ideas are
              developed at an accessible level, using practical examples from
              functional neuroimaging, and the extensions for multiple
              comparisons described. Three worked examples from PET and fMRI
              are presented, with discussion, and comparisons with standard
              parametric approaches made where appropriate. Practical
              considerations are given throughout, and relevant statistical
              concepts are expounded in appendices.",

  abstract = "Functional neuroimaging data embodies a massive multiple testing
              problem, where 100,000 correlated test statistics must be
              assessed. The familywise error rate, the chance of any false
              positives is the standard measure of Type I errors in multiple
              testing. In this paper we review and evaluate three approaches to
              thresholding images of test statistics: Bonferroni, random field
              and the permutation test. Owing to recent developments, improved
              Bonferroni procedures, such as Hochberg's methods, are now
              applicable to dependent data. Continuous random field methods use
              the smoothness of the image to adapt to the severity of the
              multiple testing problem. Also, increased computing power has
              made both permutation and bootstrap methods applicable to
              functional neuroimaging. We evaluate these approaches on t images
              using simulations and a collection of real datasets. We find that
              Bonferroni-related tests offer little improvement over
              Bonferroni, while the permutation method offers substantial
              improvement over the random field method for low smoothness and
              low degrees of freedom. We also show the limitations of trying to
              find an equivalent number of independent tests for an image of
              correlated test statistics.",

  abstract = "Psychology has historically been concerned, first and foremost,
              with explaining the causal mechanisms that give rise to behavior.
              Randomized, tightly controlled experiments are enshrined as the
              gold standard of psychological research, and there are endless
              investigations of the various mediating and moderating variables
              that govern various behaviors. We argue that psychology's
              near-total focus on explaining the causes of behavior has led
              much of the field to be populated by research programs that
              provide intricate theories of psychological mechanism but that
              have little (or unknown) ability to predict future behaviors with
              any appreciable accuracy. We propose that principles and
              techniques from the field of machine learning can help psychology
              become a more predictive science. We review some of the
              fundamental concepts and tools of machine learning and point out
              examples where these concepts have been used to conduct
              interesting and important psychological research that focuses on
              predictive research questions. We suggest that an increased focus
              on prediction, rather than explanation, can ultimately lead us to

  abstract  = "[We propose a new method for estimation in linear models. The
               `lasso' minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum
               of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a
               constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to
               produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives
               interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the
               lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset
               selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models
               like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge
               regression. There is also an interesting relationship with
               recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and
               Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in
