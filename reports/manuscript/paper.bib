              level. Having originated within the realm of diffusion NMR in the
              late 1970s, this field is experiencing an exponential growth in
              the number of publications. At the same time, model-based
              approaches are also increasingly incorporated into advanced MRI
              acquisition and reconstruction techniques. However, after about
              two decades of intellectual and financial investment,
              microstructural mapping has yet to find a single commonly
              accepted clinical application. Here, we suggest that slow

  abstract = "Diffusion MRI is arguably the method of choice for characterizing
              white matter microstructure in vivo. Over the typical duration of
              diffusion encoding, the displacement of water molecules is
              conveniently on a length scale similar to that of the underlying
              cellular structures. Moreover, water molecules in white matter
              are largely compartmentalized which enables biologically-inspired
              compartmental diffusion models to characterize and quantify the
              true biological microstructure. A plethora of white matter models
              have been proposed. However, overparameterization and
              mathematical fitting complications encourage the introduction of
              simplifying assumptions that vary between different approaches.
              These choices impact the quantitative estimation of model
              parameters with potential detriments to their biological accuracy
              and promised specificity. First, we review biophysical white
              matter models in use and recapitulate their underlying
              assumptions and realms of applicability. Second, we present
              up-to-date efforts to validate parameters estimated from
              biophysical models. Simulations and dedicated phantoms are useful
              in assessing the performance of models when the ground truth is
              known. However, the biggest challenge remains the validation of
              the ``biological accuracy'' of estimated parameters.
              Complementary techniques such as microscopy of fixed tissue
              specimens have facilitated direct comparisons of estimates of
              white matter fiber orientation and densities. However, validation
              of compartmental diffusivities remains challenging, and
              complementary MRI-based techniques such as alternative diffusion
              encodings, compartment-specific contrast agents and metabolites
              have been used to validate diffusion models. Finally, white
              matter injury and disease pose additional challenges to modeling,
              which are also discussed. This review aims to provide an overview
              of the current state of models and their validation and to

              cortical projection zones of white matter fascicles in the living
              human brain. There are many different tractography algorithms and
              each requires the user to set several parameters, such as
              curvature threshold. Choosing a single algorithm with specific
              parameters poses two challenges. First, different algorithms and
              parameter values produce different results. Second, the optimal
              choice of algorithm and parameter value may differ between
              different white matter regions or different fascicles, subjects,
              and acquisition parameters. We propose using ensemble methods to
              reduce algorithm and parameter dependencies. To do so we separate
              the processes of fascicle generation and evaluation.
              Specifically, we analyze the value of creating optimized
              connectomes by systematically combining candidate streamlines
              from an ensemble of algorithms (deterministic and probabilistic)
              and systematically varying parameters (curvature and stopping

              that provide better cross-validated prediction error of the
              diffusion MRI data than optimized connectomes generated using a
              single-algorithm or parameter set. Furthermore, the ensemble
              approach produces connectomes that contain both short- and
              long-range fascicles, whereas single-parameter connectomes are
              biased towards one or the other. In summary, a systematic
              ensemble tractography approach can produce connectomes that are
              superior to standard single parameter estimates both for

               However a fundamental limitation of this technology is its
               non-quantitative nature, i.e. the density of reconstructed
               connections is not reflective of the density of underlying white

               published the ``spherical-deconvolution informed filtering of

               orientation information from diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI)
               data, overcoming the crossing fibre limitations inherent in the
               diffusion tensor model. It is routinely used to obtain high
               quality fibre orientation distribution function (fODF) estimates
               and fibre tractograms and is increasingly used to obtain
               apparent fibre density (AFD) measures. Unfortunately, CSD
               typically only supports data acquired on a single shell in
               q-space. With multi-shell data becoming more and more prevalent,
               there is a growing need for CSD to fully support such data.
               Furthermore, CSD can only provide high quality fODF estimates in
               voxels containing WM only. In voxels containing other tissue
               types such as grey matter (GM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF),
               the WM response function may no longer be appropriate and
               spherical deconvolution produces unreliable, noisy fODF

               multi-shell data into the CSD approach as well as to exploit the
               unique b-value dependencies of the different tissue types to

               In addition, compared to SSST-CSD, MSMT-CSD can substantially
               increase the precision of the fODF fibre orientations and reduce

              diffusion anisotropy imaging. The aim is to estimate microscopic
              features specific to the intra- and extra-neurite compartments in
              nervous tissue unconfounded by the effects of fibre crossings and
              orientation dispersion, which are ubiquitous in the brain. The
              proposed MRI method is based on the Spherical Mean Technique
              (SMT), which factors out the neurite orientation distribution and
              thus provides direct estimates of the microscopic tissue
              structure. This technique can be immediately used in the clinic
              for the assessment of various neurological conditions, as it
              requires only a widely available off-the-shelf sequence with two
              b-shells and high-angular gradient resolution achievable within

              1400-1800 x 10(-6) mm2/s) is almost 10 times higher than the

              currently exist for noninvasive tracking of neuronal connections

              in animals through invasive tracer techniques, but these invasive
              studies cannot be done in humans, and animal results cannot
              always be extrapolated to human systems. We have developed

              utilizing the unique ability of MRI to characterize water
              diffusion. We reconstructed fiber trajectories throughout the
              brain by tracking the direction of fastest diffusion (the fiber
              direction) from a grid of seed points, and then selected tracks

              permutation testing provides a flexible and intuitive methodology
              for the statistical analysis of data from functional neuroimaging
              experiments, at some computational expense. Introduced into the
              functional neuroimaging literature by Holmes et al. ([1996]: J
              Cereb Blood Flow Metab 16:7-22), the permutation approach readily
              accounts for the multiple comparisons problem implicit in the
              standard voxel-by-voxel hypothesis testing framework. When the
              appropriate assumptions hold, the nonparametric permutation
              approach gives results similar to those obtained from a
              comparable Statistical Parametric Mapping approach using a
              general linear model with multiple comparisons corrections
              derived from random field theory. For analyses with low degrees
              of freedom, such as single subject PET/SPECT experiments or
              multi-subject PET/SPECT or fMRI designs assessed for population
              effects, the nonparametric approach employing a locally pooled
              (smoothed) variance estimate can outperform the comparable
              Statistical Parametric Mapping approach. Thus, these
              nonparametric techniques can be used to verify the validity of
              less computationally expensive parametric approaches. Although
              the theory and relative advantages of permutation approaches have
              been discussed by various authors, there has been no accessible
              explication of the method, and no freely distributed software
              implementing it. Consequently, there have been few practical
              applications of the technique. This article, and the accompanying
              MATLAB software, attempts to address these issues. The standard
              nonparametric randomization and permutation testing ideas are
              developed at an accessible level, using practical examples from
              functional neuroimaging, and the extensions for multiple
              comparisons described. Three worked examples from PET and fMRI
              are presented, with discussion, and comparisons with standard
              parametric approaches made where appropriate. Practical
              considerations are given throughout, and relevant statistical
              concepts are expounded in appendices.",

  abstract = "Functional neuroimaging data embodies a massive multiple testing
              problem, where 100,000 correlated test statistics must be
              assessed. The familywise error rate, the chance of any false
              positives is the standard measure of Type I errors in multiple
              testing. In this paper we review and evaluate three approaches to
              thresholding images of test statistics: Bonferroni, random field
              and the permutation test. Owing to recent developments, improved
              Bonferroni procedures, such as Hochberg's methods, are now
              applicable to dependent data. Continuous random field methods use
              the smoothness of the image to adapt to the severity of the
              multiple testing problem. Also, increased computing power has
              made both permutation and bootstrap methods applicable to
              functional neuroimaging. We evaluate these approaches on t images
              using simulations and a collection of real datasets. We find that
              Bonferroni-related tests offer little improvement over
              Bonferroni, while the permutation method offers substantial
              improvement over the random field method for low smoothness and
              low degrees of freedom. We also show the limitations of trying to

              with explaining the causal mechanisms that give rise to behavior.
              Randomized, tightly controlled experiments are enshrined as the
              gold standard of psychological research, and there are endless
              investigations of the various mediating and moderating variables

              near-total focus on explaining the causes of behavior has led
              much of the field to be populated by research programs that
              provide intricate theories of psychological mechanism but that
              have little (or unknown) ability to predict future behaviors with
              any appreciable accuracy. We propose that principles and
              techniques from the field of machine learning can help psychology
              become a more predictive science. We review some of the
              fundamental concepts and tools of machine learning and point out
              examples where these concepts have been used to conduct

               produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives

              Based on a simulated human brain data set with ground truth
              tracts, we organized an open international tractography
              challenge, which resulted in 96 distinct submissions from 20

              most state-of-the-art algorithms produce tractograms containing
              90\% of the ground truth bundles (to at least some extent).
              However, the same tractograms contain many more invalid than
              valid bundles, and half of these invalid bundles occur
              systematically across research groups. Taken together, our

              vivo data acquisition, such as noise, artifacts, and data
              undersampling resulting from scan time constraints. It generally
              is assumed that improvements in data quality and implementation
              of sophisticated tractography methods will lead to increasingly
              accurate maps of human anatomical connections. However, assessing
              the anatomical accuracy of DWI tractography is difficult because
              of the lack of independent knowledge of the true anatomical
              connections in humans. Here we investigate the future prospects
              of DWI-based connectional imaging by applying advanced
              tractography methods to an ex vivo DWI dataset of the macaque
              brain. The results of different tractography methods were
              compared with maps of known axonal projections from previous
              tracer studies in the macaque. Despite the exceptional quality of
              the DWI data, none of the methods demonstrated high anatomical
              accuracy. The methods that showed the highest sensitivity showed
              the lowest specificity, and vice versa. Additionally, anatomical
              accuracy was highly dependent upon parameters of the tractography
              algorithm, with different optimal values for mapping different
              pathways. These results suggest that there is an inherent
              limitation in determining long-range anatomical projections based
              on voxel-averaged estimates of local fiber orientation obtained
              from DWI data that is unlikely to be overcome by improvements in

  abstract = "Sensory, motor and cognitive operations involve the coordinated
              action of large neuronal populations across multiple brain
              regions in both superficial and deep structures. Existing
              extracellular probes record neural activity with excellent
              spatial and temporal (sub-millisecond) resolution, but from only
              a few dozen neurons per shank. Optical Ca2+ imaging offers more
              coverage but lacks the temporal resolution needed to distinguish
              individual spikes reliably and does not measure local field
              potentials. Until now, no technology compatible with use in
              unrestrained animals has combined high spatiotemporal resolution
              with large volume coverage. Here we design, fabricate and test a
              new silicon probe known as Neuropixels to meet this need. Each
              probe has 384 recording channels that can programmably address
              960 complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)
              processing-compatible low-impedance TiN sites that tile a single
              10-mm long, 70 $\times$ 20-$\mu$m cross-section shank. The 6
              $\times$ 9-mm probe base is fabricated with the shank on a single
              chip. Voltage signals are filtered, amplified, multiplexed and
              digitized on the base, allowing the direct transmission of
              noise-free digital data from the probe. The combination of dense
              recording sites and high channel count yielded well-isolated
              spiking activity from hundreds of neurons per probe implanted in
              mice and rats. Using two probes, more than 700 well-isolated
              single neurons were recorded simultaneously from five brain
              structures in an awake mouse. The fully integrated functionality
              and small size of Neuropixels probes allowed large populations of
              neurons from several brain structures to be recorded in freely
              moving animals. This combination of high-performance electrode
              technology and scalable chip fabrication methods opens a path
              towards recording of brain-wide neural activity during behaviour.",

  abstract  = "ABSTRACTMore than 50 years ago, John Tukey called for a
               reformation of academic statistics. In ?The Future of Data
               Analysis,? he pointed to the existence of an as-yet unrecognized
               science, whose subject of interest was learning from data, or
               ?data analysis.? Ten to 20 years ago, John Chambers, Jeff Wu,
               Bill Cleveland, and Leo Breiman independently once again urged
               academic statistics to expand its boundaries beyond the
               classical domain of theoretical statistics; Chambers called for
               more emphasis on data preparation and presentation rather than
               statistical modeling; and Breiman called for emphasis on
               prediction rather than inference. Cleveland and Wu even
               suggested the catchy name ?data science? for this envisioned
               field. A recent and growing phenomenon has been the emergence of
               ?data science? programs at major universities, including UC
               Berkeley, NYU, MIT, and most prominently, the University of
               Michigan, which in September 2015 announced a \$100M ?Data
               Science Initiative? that aims to hire 35 new faculty. Teaching
               in these new programs has significant overlap in curricular
               subject matter with traditional statistics courses; yet many
               academic statisticians perceive the new programs as ?cultural
               appropriation.? This article reviews some ingredients of the
               current ?data science moment,? including recent commentary about
               data science in the popular media, and about how/whether data
               science is really different from statistics. The
               now-contemplated field of data science amounts to a superset of
               the fields of statistics and machine learning, which adds some
               technology for ?scaling up? to ?big data.? This chosen superset
               is motivated by commercial rather than intellectual
               developments. Choosing in this way is likely to miss out on the
               really important intellectual event of the next 50 years.
               Because all of science itself will soon become data that can be
               mined, the imminent revolution in data science is not about mere
               ?scaling up,? but instead the emergence of scientific studies of
               data analysis science-wide. In the future, we will be able to
               predict how a proposal to change data analysis workflows would
               impact the validity of data analysis across all of science, even
               predicting the impacts field-by-field. Drawing on work by Tukey,
               Cleveland, Chambers, and Breiman, I present a vision of data
               science based on the activities of people who are ?learning from
               data,? and I describe an academic field dedicated to improving
               that activity in an evidence-based manner. This new field is a
               better academic enlargement of statistics and machine learning
               than today?s data science initiatives, while being able to
               accommodate the same short-term goals. Based on a presentation

              research has revealed many new aspects of this multifaceted
              maturation process, significantly augmenting scientific knowledge
              gathered from postmortem studies. Postnatal brain development is
              notably protracted and involves considerable changes in cerebral
              cortical, subcortical, and cerebellar structures, as well as
              significant architectural changes in white matter fiber tracts

              characterize the multidimensional nature of brain anatomy,
              capturing different phases of development among individuals.
              Capitalizing on key advances in multisite, multimodal MRI, and

              our composite metric of morphology, diffusivity, and signal
              intensity shows that the average difference in phase among
              children of the same age is only about 1 year, revealing for the

              Symptoms of chronic neuropsychiatric diseases are also
              exacerbated during ageing. However, the ageing process does not
              affect people uniformly; nor, in fact, does the ageing process
              appear to be uniform even within an individual. Here, we outline
              recent neuroimaging research into brain ageing and the use of
              other bodily ageing biomarkers, including telomere length, the
              epigenetic clock, and grip strength. Some of these techniques,
              using statistical approaches, have the ability to predict
              chronological age in healthy people. Moreover, they are now being
              applied to neurological and psychiatric disease groups to provide

  abstract = "Medical imaging has enormous potential for early disease
              prediction, but is impeded by the difficulty and expense of
              acquiring data sets before symptom onset. UK Biobank aims to
              address this problem directly by acquiring high-quality,
              consistently acquired imaging data from 100,000 predominantly
              healthy participants, with health outcomes being tracked over the
              coming decades. The brain imaging includes structural, diffusion
              and functional modalities. Along with body and cardiac imaging,
              genetics, lifestyle measures, biological phenotyping and health
              records, this imaging is expected to enable discovery of imaging
              markers of a broad range of diseases at their earliest stages, as
              well as provide unique insight into disease mechanisms. We
              describe UK Biobank brain imaging and present results derived
              from the first 5,000 participants' data release. Although this
              covers just 5\% of the ultimate cohort, it has already yielded a
              rich range of associations between brain imaging and other
              measures collected by UK Biobank.",
