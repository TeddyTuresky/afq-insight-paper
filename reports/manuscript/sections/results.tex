\section{Results}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Regression
    \begin{itemize}
      \item HCP Reading Scores
      \item Insert figure showing sparsity pattern
      \item Insert figure showing weights as they relate to tract differences visible in the browser
    \end{itemize}
  \item Classification
    \begin{itemize}
      \item ALS Classification (Sarica)
      \item Insert figure showing sparsity pattern
      \item Insert figure showing weights as they relate to tract differences visible in the browser
    \end{itemize}
  \item Failures
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Hopefully, the failures are common to both regression
        and classification so we can include them here in there own
        subsection.
      \item Insert figure demonstrating failure cases
    \end{itemize}
