# Introduction
## Tractometry vs averaging over tracts
(see AFQ-Browser paper for inspiration and political correctness)

## Existing methods

- sarica et al 2017

# Methods

## Data
(Raw measurement sources)
(AFQ pipeline)
(Insight preprocessing)

## Sparse Group Lasso
### Regression case
### Classification using logistic regression
## Computational implementation
(Figure for pipeline)

### Proximal gradient methods
### Meta-parameter optimization
### Cross-validation scheme
(Figure for cross-validation scheme)

# Results
## Regression (HCP reading scores)
(Figure showing sparsity pattern)
(Figure showing weights as related to differences visible in the browser)
## Classification (Sarica)
(Figure showing sparsity pattern)
## Failures
(Figure demonstrating failure cases)

# Conclusion
## Open and reproducible
## Feature selection + prediction
## AFQ ecosystem
